Prison-Break

This is Prison-Breaker! It is a tamagotchi style game with a main goal of escaping a prison. The player makes a character name and chooses between various options depending on what stat needs a boost. If your mood stat is low, try a walk outside. If your reputation is low, pass out some hard earned snacks. Every button tap changes multiple values and be careful! When any of the main stats hit 0, the player loses! Cash and Snacks are special stats that you are allowed to go into debt with. But watch out, prisoners always know what they are owed! Once you gain the skills to escape, try your chances with the Attempt Escape button. If your stats aren't right, the guards will catch you!

Technologies used: HTML, Java Script, CSS.
